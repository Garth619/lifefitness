[dropcap]W[/dropcap]e talked to a long list of New York startups during Disrupt NY, but we were also joined by a local nonprofit called Brooklyn on Tech. As co-founders Jessica Santana and Evin Robinson explained in the video above, they both grew up in Brooklyn themselves. Before I dive into the many ways that Peter Thiel gets the lean methodology as wrong as a glowing review of 50 Shades of Grey, let me say this: He is one incredibly savvy dude. Most of the time, Thiel undoubtedly deserves his confidence in his business intuition. Sometimes, however, he does not. His total, utter misunderstanding of Lean Startup methodology springs to mind.

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure
