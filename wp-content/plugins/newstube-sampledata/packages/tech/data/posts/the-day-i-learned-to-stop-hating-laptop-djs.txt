[dropcap]T[/dropcap]hanks to the JOBS Act, the world of equity crowdfunding is blowing wide open. FlashFunders, an equity crowdfunding platform, is announcing a new program that automates the process for entrepreneurs, making it entirely free to raise or invest in a seed round. If you’re looking to meet new people but don’t want to explicitly commit to it being a date, as on Tinder, a new app called Wiith wants to help. The social app aims to connect nearby people who share the same interests and have them join up for local activities and events – like a more informal version of Meetup, perhaps.

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
