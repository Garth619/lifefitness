Gallery Title &amp; Description displays using short codes: I moieifdd the plugin to display the Title &amp; Description for the gallery using the short codes. If anyone would like the code feel free to email me. Thank you Zack, excellent plugin. I had to mod your plugin because I went to the trouble of creating several galleries and added the title &amp; description to them only to learn there were no short codes to display them. Anyway, I am sure you will add this feature to a future release but I thought I would release my addition to your code until you do. Thank you for all your hard work on this excellent plugin!.
